A repository to document my python learning journey

About Me: My name is Susan Zhang, and my background is in audio and speech signal processing. I have been working in this field for more than 20 years, and truly enjoy working in this field and am proud of the projects that I have been working on before. 

Goal for This Course: I am looking to enhance my Python programming skills through taking this course, and preparing me for shifting from classic signal processing domain to machine learning.

My First Python Program: print "Hello, World!"
